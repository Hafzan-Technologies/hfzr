##### CS Executive & BBA (Financial Markets) Student | Certified Google Analytics & Bing Ads Professional | Investment Banking Analyst

Enthusiastic and driven, I am currently pursuing studies in Financial Markets while working towards my CS qualification. My educational journey has ignited a strong passion for understanding market dynamics, analyzing trends, and making informed investment decisions.

With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to continuous learning, I aspire to channel my knowledge into a rewarding career as an investment analyst. I believe that every data point tells a story, and I'm excited to uncover the narratives that drive financial success.

I am open to connecting with others to share insights, collaborate on financial projects, or engage in conversations about the dynamic world of investments. Let's explore the possibilities together!
